Implementation Approach

Start Simple: Begin with a single-node key-value store
Add Networking: Implement the async network layer
Basic Consensus: Add a simplified Raft implementation
Storage Engine: Implement both memory and disk storage
Multi-Node: Extend to multi-node operation
CLI: Build the management interface
Sharding: Add data sharding capabilities
Benchmarking: Compare performance with Redis
Optimization: Identify and fix bottlenecks





GET <key>            - Retrieve a value
SET <key> <value>    - Store a value
DELETE <key>         - Remove a key
KEYS                 - List all keys


What is Primary-Backup Replication?
In this model:

One node is designated as the "primary" (or leader)
Other nodes are "backups" (or followers)
All write operations go to the primary node
The primary replicates operations to all backups
If the primary fails, a backup can be promoted to primary
